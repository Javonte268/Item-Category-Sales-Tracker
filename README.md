## 💡 Key Insights
From early 2023 to early 2024, category sales data revealed clear seasonal trends and varying performance across product types.  
- **Food** sales peaked sharply in December 2023, likely due to holiday-driven demand, marking the most significant monthly increase among all categories.  
- **Clothing** and **furniture** showed high volatility throughout the year, suggesting sensitivity to seasonal changes or promotional events.  
- **Electronics** remained relatively stable, with a slight increase toward the end of the year, indicating consistent consumer interest.  
- All categories saw a steep decline in January 2024, possibly reflecting a seasonal downturn or incomplete data.

These patterns highlight the need for strategic planning — especially around year-end inventory and promotions — and close monitoring of more unpredictable categories like clothing and furniture.
